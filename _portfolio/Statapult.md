- Explored the impact of four variables (pull back angle, release angle, eye hook position, and tension arm position) on statapult firing range using a $2_{IV}^{4-1}$ fractional factorial design
- Created a firing table by iteratively finding minimum variance factor combinations for each target range and achieved high model predictability ($R^2$ > 90%)
