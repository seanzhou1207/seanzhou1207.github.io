- Visualized crime data on 50 U.S. states from 1970 to 2018 to discover state heterogeneities in U.S. robbery rate
- Used a mixed, unpooled and a hierarchical model to estimate the effect of implementing the shall-issue law on robbery rate
- All three models show that the passing of the law reduces robbery rates in the long run
