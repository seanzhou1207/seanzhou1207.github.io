## About me ðŸ‘€
I first came to the U.S. at the age of 15 and eventually became an immigrant when I was in college. Despite my initial passion in finance (and Spanish), I decided to switch to statistics after a summer internship at a hedge fund. I love to apply statistical thinking to all things related to healthcare innovation and biomedical research. Currently, I am a biostatistician working in clinical research related to Alzheimer's disease. 

In my free time, I like to play music (guitar and keyboard), practice brazilian jiu-jitsu, and snowboard (when it's cold enough).
